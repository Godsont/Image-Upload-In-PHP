# File Upload in PHP

Here is the code to upload images (files) to your web server using PHP. Here we copy the image to the server and then insert the path of the image to the database.

To run this code, you need to have a database called fileupload with a table profilepic and two columns id (int) and profilepic (varchar)

Also create a folder called img to store the uploaded images.
